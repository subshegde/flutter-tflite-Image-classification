Sooty Mould on Mangoes:
Sooty mould is a fungal disease characterized by a black, velvety coating on mango leaves, twigs, and fruits. It grows on honeydew, a sugary substance secreted by sap-sucking insects, and while it doesn't directly infect plant tissues, it reduces photosynthesis and fruit yield.
Cause

Sooty mould fungi (e.g., Capnodium species) grow on honeydew excreted by sap-sucking insects.
Responsible insects:
1) Mealybugs
2) Whiteflies
3) Aphids
4) Scales
5) Leafhoppers

Symptoms:

Black, soot-like coating on leaves, twigs, and fruits.
Affected areas appear dull, dirty, or unhealthy.

Impact:

Forms a physical barrier, reducing sunlight penetration.
Leads to:
1) Lower photosynthesis
2) Stunted growth
3) Smaller fruits
4) Premature leaf drop (in severe cases)

Management Strategies:

Insect Control:
Use horticultural oils or insecticidal soaps to target honeydew-producing pests.
Encourage natural predators like ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps.

Ant Control:
Ants protect sap-sucking insects; control them using baits or barriers.

Cultural Practices:
Prune and destroy heavily infested branches.
Maintain proper tree spacing for better airflow.
Remove fallen leaves and debris regularly.

Physical Removal:
Wash affected areas with strong water jets or a mild soap-water solution.

Fungicide Use:
Apply copper-based fungicides only for severe infestations.
Avoid overuse to prevent resistance or residue issues.

General Tree Care:
Provide balanced fertilization and proper irrigation.
Healthy trees are more resilient to pests and diseases.

Conclusion:
Sooty mould is a secondary issue caused by insect infestations. Controlling sap-sucking insects and maintaining tree health are the most effective prevention strategies.
