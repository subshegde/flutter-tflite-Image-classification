Mango Gall Midges

Mango gall midges are small flies that damage mango trees by forming galls
on leaves, flowers, and young fruits. These galls form when midge larvae feed
inside plant tissues.

SYMPTOMS:

1. Leaf Galls:
- Appear as small, wart-like blisters on the underside of leaves.
- Infested leaves may curl, turn yellow, and drop early.
- This reduces photosynthesis and lowers fruit yield.

2. Flower and Fruit Damage:
- Inflorescences may not open properly.
- Galls may form on fruit stems, causing fruit drop.

TYPES:

1. Mango Leaf Gall Midge (Procontarinia spp.):
- Targets leaves and causes typical gall formation.

2. Mango Blossom Gall Midge (Procontarinia mangiferae):
- Affects flowers and young fruits.
- Can severely damage inflorescences.

CONTROL MEASURES:

A. Organic Methods:
- Neem oil or neem seed kernel extract is effective.
- Use of parasitoids like Tetrastichus sp. to control larvae naturally.

B. Chemical Methods:
- Insecticides like Dimethoate, Phosphamidon, or Monocrotophos.
- Apply early in the infestation phase for best results.

Note:
Use chemicals only when necessary and follow safety guidelines.
Integrated pest management combining both methods is recommended.
